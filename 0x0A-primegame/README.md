# 0x0A. Prime Game

### This directory contains a python script that creates a function which leverages understanding of prime numbers, game theory and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario.

# APPROACH
The function `isWinner(x: int, nums: list[int])` determines the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. In the function `x` is the number of rounds (assumed to always be < 10,000) for the game session and `nums` is an array of `n` (also assumed to be < 10,000).
